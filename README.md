💡 IoT Light Scheduler with MQTT, WebSocket & Arduino

This project simulates a real-world IoT dashboard to schedule a light using a graphical browser interface and network communication. The system allows users to schedule ON/OFF times via a frontend and sends these times through a Python WebSocket server to MQTT. A Python MQTT subscriber then relays commands to an Arduino via serial to control a relay (light).

📦 Features

⏰ Schedule light ON/OFF times from browser
🌐 MQTT message relay using mosquitto_pub/sub
🔌 Arduino serial communication to switch relay
🖥️ Web interface with clean UI for interaction
🧪 Fully simulated IoT pipeline
🔧 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend Server: Python (websockets, subprocess)
MQTT Broker: Mosquitto (test broker or local)
MQTT Tools: mosquitto_pub, mosquitto_sub
Microcontroller: Arduino UNO (via USB Serial)
Serial Comm: pyserial (Python)

🚀 How It Works

1. Frontend (HTML + JS)

Users input ON and OFF times.
Times are sent to the WebSocket server on button click.
2. WebSocket Server (Python)
Receives schedule via WebSocket from frontend.
Forwards ON and OFF times to MQTT using mosquitto_pub.
3. MQTT Subscriber (Python)
Uses mosquitto_sub to listen to schedule messages.
Sends ON or OFF over serial (USB) to Arduino.

4. Arduino

Listens via serial.
Triggers relay based on '1' (ON) or '0' (OFF) signals.
🛠️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Arduino IDE with code uploaded to UNO

Python 3.11+

Mosquitto installed (with mosquitto_pub and mosquitto_sub)

Python packages:

pip install websockets pyserial
Upload Arduino Code Upload light_controller.ino to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
Start the WebSocket Server
cd websocket_server
python server.py
This will listen on ws://localhost:8765. 3. Start the MQTT Subscriber

cd mqtt_subscriber
python subscriber.py
Make sure the COM port is correctly set in the script.

Open Frontend Open frontend/index.html in your browser. Enter ON/OFF times and hit Set Schedule.
